                    I am still quite active on it. I do not post everyday and it is moreso used for me to post pictures I took while I was 
                    on a trip, or some of my posts are taken directly off of my TikTok account and reposted here. This is a more personal 
                    platform for me to use since this is where I connect more with my friends and family as opposed to TikTok"
