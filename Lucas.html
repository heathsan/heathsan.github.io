                    <h3>Dopamine Information</h3>
                    “Dopamine is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families.” (Conrad 2018)
                    Dopamine plays a crucial role in our bodies controlling a multitude of factors. It plays a role in
                    executive functions, motivation, pain and pleasure management, reinforcement, and our reward system.
                    It
                    does this in a healthy individual by sending “signaling cascades that are exerted via binding to
                    dopaminergic receptors” (Conrad). This means that dopamine is used as a chemical messenger between
                    dopaminergic neurons in the brain. It can be excitatory or inhibitory depending where in the brain
                    and
                    which receptor it binds to. When your brain is expecting a reward for doing something it enjoys,
                    dopamine is released. Creating a cycle of motivation, reward and then reinforcement. A healthy
                    person
                    with normal dopamine levels will most likely feel alert, focused, motivated, and happy.
                    Dopamine receptors are metabotropic and meditate their effects through G-proteins. This means the
                    effects of dopamine are slow acting and long lasting as opposed to ionotropic receptors that are
                    fast
                    acting. There are 6 dopaminergic receptors known so far, these are D1, D2a, D2b, D3, D4, and D5
                    (Williams College Neuroscience). While there are around 86 billion neurons in the brain, only about
                    1
                    million of those are dopaminergic cells. These limited cells though are well distributed throughout
                    4
                    major tracts of the brain. There is the nigrostriatal tract beginning in the substantia nigra that
                    aids
                    in motor control. There is the tuberoinfundibular tract that aids in the control of hormones. There
                    are
                    2 more tracts that are housed in the mesolimbocortical system, these aid in motivation, emotional
                    behavior, and organized thought processes (Williams College Neuroscience). Dopamine is synthesized
                    from
                    its precursor L-DOPA in the nerve terminal where it is held until an electrical impulse called an
                    action
                    potential travels down the axon of the neuron to release it. This process is called exocytosis.

                    <h3>GABA Information</h3>
                    GABA is an important neurotransmitter that is integral in regulation of the brain’s communication.
                    GABA’s main role is to inhibit activity of the neurons it binds to. In relation to dopamine, the
                    brain
                    uses GABA to reduce the amount of dopamine released into the nucleus accumbens. GABA is produced
                    from
                    glutamate in inhibitory neurons called GABAergic neurons. GABA plays a role in sleep, relieving
                    anxiety
                    and stress, blood pressure regulation, heart rate, brain development, pain, glucagon secretion, and
                    immune response. It is a highly diverse and important neurotransmitter. It has both ionotropic such
                    as
                    the ligand gated ion channel GABAa, and metabotropic receptors such as the GABAb, throughout the
                    central
                    and peripheral nervous system.

                    <h3>Brain Regions Involved in Opioid Dependence</h3>
                    There are several regions of the brain known to be involved with opioid addiction. These include the
                    ventral tegmental area (VTA), pre-frontal cortex (PFC), the basal ganglia, more specifically the
                    nucleus
                    accumbens (NAc), the locus ceruleus (LC) and the amygdala. The VTA and NAc make up part of what is
                    called the mesolimbic reward system or the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which is a series of
                    channels in
                    the brain that are responsible for motivation, reward, pleasure and reinforcing stimuli (Kosten,
                    M.D. et
                    al.). Anytime a person does something enjoyable or pleasurable, dopaminergic action potentials (AP)
                    are
                    sent from the ventral tegmental area (one of the primary dopamine production sites in the brain) to
                    the
                    nucleus accumbens. There are also the mesocortical dopamine pathways and the nigrostriatal dopamine
                    pathways. In this essay I will be focusing on the areas of the brain associated with the mesolimbic
                    reward system.
                    The nucleus accumbens is a subcortical nucleus, part of the striatum and basal ganglia. It is
                    strongly
                    associated with reward and reinforcement. “It is here in the NAc, where dopamine primarily mediates
                    feelings of pleasure and reward” (Bridges, 2016). The NAc also plays a crucial role in day to day
                    activities, not just drug seeking behavior. Some of its main functions are positive reinforcement of
                    behaviors, aversion (negative reinforcement), processing fear, and it also plays a role in slow wave
                    sleep (non-REM).
                    The Ventral tegmental area of the brain is made up of dopamine-containing neurons that interact
                    strongly
                    with the PFC and the NAc. The VTA is curial in the expression of behaviors associated with drug use.
                    It
                    contains the most dopaminergic neurons in the brain, which in a healthy person are regulated by
                    inhibitory neurotransmitters (NT) such as GABA to keep regular amounts of dopamine circulating
                    within
                    the dopaminergic pathways. When an individual abuses opioids this inhibitory process is prevented
                    from
                    doing its job correctly, greatly increasing the amount of dopamine released from the VTA. After
                    repeated
                    abuse the brain will attempt to correct this imbalance and produce more inhibitory NTs. This forces
                    the
                    user to have to take more and more of the substance to feel the desired effects (Kosten, M.D. et
                    al.).
                    The Pre-frontal cortex (PFC) is a large part of the brain that plays too many roles to be summarized
                    fully in this essay. But in relation to opioid abuse the PFC plays a role in executive function.
                    This
                    means decision making, self-control, planning and general higher cognitive function. In a healthy
                    person
                    the PFC controls the VTA and prevents drives or behaviors that would be unhealthy, like abusing
                    substances that are potentially harmful. “But this feedback appears to be compromised in individuals
                    who
                    become addicted to drugs” (Kosten, M.D. et al.). This reduction of the PFC’s control leads to
                    maladaptive behaviors. Examples would be drug seeking behavior, despite knowing the legal and health
                    ramifications of illicit drug use.
                    The locus ceruleus (LC) is a nucleus in the brain stem. Its primary role is to synthesize
                    norepinephrine
                    or noradrenaline (NA) “a brain chemical that stimulates wakefulness, muscle tone, and respiration,
                    among
                    other functions.” (Kosten, M.D. et al.). When a person is administered opioids the NA production
                    process
                    inside the neuron is inhibited, reducing release of NA. When abuse of the opioid such as heroin
                    continues, the brain attempts to correct the imbalance by increasing materials needed for NA inside
                    the
                    LC neurons. This process results in some of the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, which will be
                    discussed
                    more in depth later in this essay.
